# dotnet-snippets

⚠️ This is work in progress.

This tool can be used to generate properly colored HTML snippets for C# (and presumably VB.NET) code. Given a project and a document name, it will run 
the [Roslyn classifier](https://www.strathweb.com/2020/06/c-semantic-classification-with-roslyn/) to determine the semantic type of each token in the document.

It can also transform theme files to CSS style definitions.
